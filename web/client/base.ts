/**
 * The deploy prefix, computed once.
 *
 * The Pages workflow passes the full public URL in `BASE_URL`; locally it is unset and the site is
 * served from the root. Everything that emits a URL reads it from here — the routes, and through
 * them every page — which is why it sits in `client/` with them.
 *
 * It reads the variable off `globalThis` rather than through `Deno.env` because nothing in
 * `client/` is type-checked with `deno.ns`: a file here may not name a runtime the browser does not
 * have. Nothing is lost by that. The prefix is a render-time value — by the time a browser sees a
 * page the prefix is already in its HTML — so a browser has no variable to read and no use for one.
