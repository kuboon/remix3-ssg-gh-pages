/**
 * The site, wired by hand.
 *
 * Route definitions live in `routes.ts` and this file maps them to the pages that render them —
 * the shape a Remix app has. `pageAction` is the whole of the mapping: a page module exports a
 * component and its title, and that is a response.
 *
 * The pages it renders live in `client/`, along with the islands they place: everything the
 * browser is ever given, in the half of the workspace that is type-checked without `deno.ns`. This
 * half has the runtime — the file reads, the bundler, the environment — and hands the other half
 * what it needs to render.
 *
 * The rest of the site is mapped the same way as a page. The browser modules and the files under
 * `client/static/` are directories rather than pages, so each is one wildcard route handing off to
 * the thing that serves it; the Markdown articles are not a directory at all here — `blog/` answers
 * its routes like any other page.
 *
 * So what is exported is a plain `@remix-run/fetch-router` router. `deno serve router.ts` runs it
 * as the dev server and the build crawls the same object; both need only `fetch`. Nothing here is a
 * framework convention — the directory names, the routes and the deploy rules are all stated here.
