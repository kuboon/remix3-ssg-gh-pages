# web

A static-site starter built with [Remix v3](https://remix.run) — `remix/ui` for
rendering — and [`@kuboon/remix-ssg`](https://jsr.io/@kuboon/remix-ssg) for
everything around it. The output is plain HTML that deploys to GitHub Pages:
zero client-side JavaScript by default, with opt-in interactivity through
hydrated islands.

## Two halves

The workspace has one member for each side of the wire:

|           |                                                                       | checked with        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `client/` | pages, islands, routes, tokens — everything the browser is ever given | `dom`, no `deno.ns` |
| `server/` | the router, the bundler, the file reads, the build                    | `deno.ns` and `dom` |

Only `server/` is type-checked with the Deno namespace, so a `Deno.` anywhere in
`client/` is a build error rather than a surprise in the browser. Nothing else
enforces the line — no bundler config, no naming convention, one `lib` each.

`server/` may read from `client/` and does: it imports the pages to render them,
compiles the islands, and serves `client/static/`. Nothing goes the other way.

## How it works

`client/routes.ts` states every URL the site answers, `client/pages/` renders
them, and `server/router.ts` maps one to the other — the shape a Remix app has:

```ts
router.get(routes.about, aboutAction);
```

The rest of the site is mapped the same way. A directory is a wildcard route
handing a subtree to whatever already serves one:

```ts
router.map(`${base}/static/*path`, ({ request }) => staticFiles.fetch(request));
router.map(`${assetsPath}/*path`, ({ request }) => assets.fetch(request));
```

So `server/router.ts` default-exports a plain `@remix-run/fetch-router` router,
with nothing wrapped around it. `deno serve` and the build both want the same
thing from it — `fetch` — and everything the build additionally needs (`base`,
`entryPoints`, `fileServer`) is a named export beside it.

The Markdown articles are pages like any other. `server/blog/mod.ts` sits in the
directory the `.md` files are in and answers both blog routes — the listing and
one article — so `server/router.ts` maps the group in one line:

```ts
router.map(routes.blog, blogController);
```

Their URLs are the one thing not enumerated in `client/routes.ts`: they come
from the files on disk, so `routes.blog.show` states only the _shape_ of an
article URL, for the listing to link with.

`deno task dev` runs that handler as the dev server. The build drives the very
same object with `fetch()`, writes each response to disk, and follows the links
it finds — so what you see locally is what gets generated, and moving to a live
server would be a change of deploy target rather than of code.

There is no build script in this repository. `deno task build` runs the
generator straight from JSR.

## Requirements

[Deno](https://deno.com) 2.x.

## Commands

```sh
deno task dev     # local dev server at http://localhost:8000
deno task build   # generate the static site into dist/
deno task check   # type-check, lint, and format-check
```

`dev` and `build` are `server/`'s tasks; the ones at the root run them there, so
either directory works. `check` runs `deno check` in each member — with that
member's `lib`, which is the whole point — then lints and format-checks the
workspace.

Neither task passes `-A` or `--unstable-bundle`. `server/deno.json` carries a
permission set for each (`-P=dev`, `-P=build`) and the root config the
`"unstable": ["bundle"]` the bundler needs — which is also why `deno task build`
names `-c deno.json`: a remote main module reads a project's config only when it
is told to.

The root `imports` names each package once. A subpath resolves from that entry,
so `@remix-run/ui/menu`, `@kuboon/remix-ssg/site` and `@std/front-matter/yaml`
all work without a line of their own — and adding one would only be a second
place to bump the version.

## Project layout

```
web/
  deno.json          # the workspace: members, imports, tasks, lint + fmt
  deno.lock          # pinned dependency versions (committed)
  client/
    deno.json        # lib: dom — no deno.ns, so nothing here can reach for Deno
    routes.ts        # every URL the site answers
    base.ts          # the deploy prefix, computed once
    tokens.ts        # design tokens — colors, fonts, radii, the measure
    theme.ts         # the css() mixins more than one module uses
    hydration.ts     # run() — the client runtime, loaded by a page that hydrates
    pages/
      index.tsx      # home — places two client entries
      about.tsx

      blog/
        index.tsx    # the listing screen
        article.tsx  # the article screen
    islands/
      counter.tsx    # a hydrated island, and its own browser entrypoint
      total.tsx      # a second island/entrypoint, sharing state with it
      store.ts       # the module both islands import — the shared singleton
    static/
      app.css        # tokens, document defaults, the cascade layer order
      favicon.svg
  server/
    deno.json        # lib: deno.ns — plus the tasks and their permission sets
    router.ts        # the wiring — routes to pages, plus the rest of the site
    layout.tsx       # the HTML document shell
    assets.ts        # client/ compiled as one graph
    versions.ts      # the showcase's badges, read off the import map
    blog/
      mod.ts         # the articles, and both blog routes
      *.md           # the articles
  dist/              # the build's output (gitignored)
```

Two files sit across the line on purpose. `client/base.ts` reads `BASE_URL` off
`globalThis` rather than through `Deno.env`, because a prefix is a render-time
value that the browser is never told and `client/` may not name `Deno`; and the
blog's screens are in `client/pages/blog/` while the module that reads the `.md`
files beside them is `server/blog/`. Each screen states the shape it needs of an
article, and the server's own `Article` is a superset of both.

## The UI showcase (delete me)

`client/pages/showcase.tsx` and `client/islands/showcase/` are a port of
[remix3-ui-showcase](https://github.com/kuboon/remix3-ui-showcase): every
first-party `@remix-run/ui` component and the animation primitives, each an
island whose parameters you can change live. It is here to demonstrate the
framework, and the root README lists it first among the things to delete in a
repository made from this template.

It is also the largest thing the island pipeline is asked to do here — 18
entrypoints compiled as one graph, sharing `@remix-run/ui` and the demo chrome
through code-split chunks rather than 18 copies.

Helpers the demos share live in `client/islands/showcase/_lib/`. Nothing
enforces the underscore any more — `server/assets.ts` lists its entrypoints, so
a file is one because it is named there, not because of where it sits.

## Styling

Almost every rule is a `css(...)` mixin from `@remix-run/ui`, attached to an
element with `mix`:

```tsx
const cardStyle = css({
  padding: "1.25rem",
  border: `1px solid ${color.border}`,
  borderRadius: radius.lg,
  "&:hover": { borderColor: color.accent },
  "@media (min-width: 40rem)": { padding: "2rem" },
});

<section mix={cardStyle}>…</section>;
```

`renderToString` collects the mixins a page actually rendered and writes them
into that page's `<head>` as `<style>` tags. So a page carries its own CSS and
nothing else: no rules for parts of the site the reader never opened, and no
class name that has to agree with a file somewhere else. The one stylesheet the
site does link is `client/static/app.css`, and the next section is what it is
for.

### The cascade

Generated `css(...)` rules — this site's, and the ones first-party `remix/ui`
components carry — all land in the native `rmx` cascade layer, and a mixin
cannot choose its layer. So `client/static/app.css` declares the full order, and
`server/layout.tsx` links it at the top of `<head>`:

```css
@layer base, rmx, app;
```

Layers rank by where they are first named, which is why that link has to come
out ahead of Remix's own rules — Remix appends its collected styles just before
`</head>`.

| Layer  | What is in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base` | `app.css`. Tokens, the box model, and defaults for elements nobody styles by hand (`body`, `a`, `h1`, `code`). Being _before_ `rmx`, every one is a default a component may override — which is why nothing here needs `:where()` or `!important`. |
| `rmx`  | Remix's. Every mixin on this site, and the styling `remix/ui` components bring with them.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `app`  | Empty, and named anyway: where a rule would go that has to beat a component's own styling on purpose. Unlayered CSS would also win, but it would win by accident.                                                                                  |

### Where a style goes

- **Token values live in `client/static/app.css`; `client/tokens.ts` names
  them.** Remix supplies behaviour and a little component styling, not a theme,
  so the palette, typography and radii are the app's. They are custom properties
  because light and dark swap between two sets of them, and `tokens.ts` exports
  the `var(--…)` references rather than a second copy of the values. Islands
  import from `tokens.ts` and only from there — a `css(...)` call at module
  scope is not something the bundler will drop, so importing `theme.ts` would
  pull the whole shell into an island's chunk.
- **Mixins used by more than one module live in `client/theme.ts`.** A style
  used in one place belongs in that file, under a `// --- styles ---` heading at
  the bottom — see `server/layout.tsx` or `client/pages/index.tsx`.
- **`mix` takes an array**, so mixins compose: `mix={[bandStyle, headerStyle]}`
  is what a stylesheet would have said with a grouped selector. When an element
  also has behaviour, the `on(...)` handlers go last.
- **A page that needs more room than the measure takes it itself.**
  `client/pages/showcase.tsx` brings its own layout, so its wrapper sets
  `margin-inline: calc(50% - 50vw)` and widens from the main column to the full
  viewport — no flag reaches the shell for it, and its background finally spans
  both edges. `app.css` pairs that with `overflow-x: clip` on `body`, so `50vw`
  (which counts the scrollbar) cannot drag a horizontal scrollbar behind the
  vertical one.
- **Nesting reaches markup this site does not write.** `theme.ts`'s `proseStyle`
  dresses the Markdown articles with `& h2`, `& pre`, `& table` and friends,
  scoped to the one class on the article wrapper instead of leaking out as bare
  element selectors.

`client/static/` holds `app.css` and anything else served verbatim (the favicon,
images).

## Adding a page

Three edits, in the order you would guess:

1. Name its URL in `client/routes.ts` — `contact: get("/contact")`.
2. Write `client/pages/contact.tsx`, exporting a component as `default` plus a
   `title` — and `hydrate = true` if it places a client entry.
3. Map them in `server/router.ts` —
   `router.get(routes.contact, pageAction(Contact))`.

An **article** needs none of that: drop a `.md` file under `server/blog/` and it
is served at its own name.

The crawl starts at `entryPoints` in `server/router.ts` and follows links, so
**what is reachable is what gets generated**. A page nothing links to belongs in
`entryPoints`, or it is not part of the site.

That is also why the blog controller reads the article files: listing them is
what makes them reachable.

## Markdown content

Each article is a `.md` file under `server/blog/` with `title`, `date`, and
`summary` front-matter:

```markdown
---
title: Hello, remix-ssg
date: "2026-07-21"
summary: How this site is rendered to static HTML at build time.
---

Body starts here…
```

`server/blog/mod.ts` turns it into a page: front-matter via `@std/front-matter`,
the body via [`@kuboon/md`](https://jsr.io/@kuboon/md) — GitHub-flavored,
sanitized, with heading anchors and Shiki-highlighted code. It is the only
module importing either package, and the only one that reads the files; the two
screens beside it, `index.tsx` and `article.tsx`, are handed what they render.
The generator never sees Markdown at all — it serves what this site's own
controller returns.

`mod.ts` finds the files through `import.meta.dirname`, being in the directory
with them, so no path to the articles is written down anywhere. Nothing serves
that directory as files, either, which is why the source can sit beside the
`.md` without becoming a URL.

## Interactive islands (client components)

Most of the site is static HTML. When you need interactivity, use an **island**:
a component that is server-rendered like everything else, then hydrated in the
browser. See `client/islands/counter.tsx`.

To add one:

1. Write it in `client/islands/` with
   ``clientEntry(`${import.meta.url}#Export`, …)`` from `@remix-run/ui` — the
   module naming itself, which is one string fewer to keep in step with a file
   name. Call `handle.update()` after changing state.
2. Add it to `entrypoints` in `server/assets.ts`.
3. Import it into a page and place it, and set `export const hydrate = true` on
   that page.

A page that does not set `hydrate` ships no `<script>` at all — the article
pages have none.

### How the client code is compiled

Every island is a browser entrypoint, and all of them go into a _single_
`Deno.bundle({ codeSplitting: true })` call. A module more than one of them
imports comes out **once**, in a chunk they share:

```
client/hydration.js ─┬─→ chunk-…   the Remix UI runtime
islands/counter.js  ─┤
islands/total.js    ─┴─→ chunk-…   store.ts
```

The home page demonstrates why that matters. `counter.tsx` and `total.tsx` are
separate entrypoints that never reference each other; both import
`client/islands/store.ts`, and the running total tracks the buttons only because
that store was emitted once. Compile the entries independently — one bundler
call each — and each gets a private copy, so the total would sit at zero.

`client/hydration.ts` is an entrypoint like the islands, and the only script the
shell writes: it calls `run()`, which walks the document for the hydration
markers the server emitted and imports each island by the URL named there.

That URL is resolved on the server, by `resolveClientEntry` in
`server/assets.ts` — `clientEntry`'s id is the island's own module URL, and
turning that into a chunk URL needs both the deploy prefix and the bundler's
output naming, neither of which the browser has. The id is read only there:
`$entryId` is what `renderToStream` passes to the hook, and nothing in the
client runtime looks at it, which is why the same expression may mean a `file:`
URL on one side and a chunk URL on the other. The same hook asks for the chunk
to be preloaded, which earns its keep twice: the browser fetches it while the
runtime is still starting, and the build's crawl gets a `<link>` to follow.
Without that link the chunks are named only inside the hydration JSON, where
nothing looking for links can see them — and the build writes four assets
instead of thirty-eight.

### Links, and why the shell streams

Every URL lives in `client/routes.ts` as a `@remix-run/fetch-router` route map,
and links go through it:

```tsx
<a href={routes.about.href()}>About</a>;
```

The map is built with the deploy prefix as its base, so an href is already
correct under a repo sub-path or a PR preview URL — `route('', …)` gives
`/about`, `route('/repo/preview', …)` gives `/repo/preview/about` — and nothing
has to remember to prepend `base`. That is also why `home` needs no special
case: the base alone is the home path. Nothing enforces that a route points at a
page that exists, but nothing needs to: the build crawls the links it finds, so
a route with no page behind it fails the build.

The blog is in the map too, as `blog: { index: "/blog", show: "/blog/:slug" }`.
No list of articles belongs there — they are Markdown files discovered at build
time — but the shape of their URL does, so the listing links with
`routes.blog.show.href({ slug })`. That call percent-encodes the slug itself,
which is why nothing around it encodes anything.

Internal links are plain `<a href>`. On a page with an island the client runtime
is active, and it turns every internal `<a>` click into a frame navigation: it
fetches the destination and swaps the document in place. That works — the new
page's islands hydrate, the back button behaves, styles come with it — but only
because the shell renders through `renderToStream`.

`renderToString` is `renderToStream` with `stripFlushMarkers()` over the result,
and the marker it strips, `<!-- rmx:flush document -->`, is exactly how the
runtime recognises a whole document rather than a fragment. Serve pages without
it and an internal link changes the URL while leaving the page alone, silently:
no error, no console warning, and the fetch even returns 200. So
`server/layout.tsx` uses `renderToStream` and reads the stream to a string
itself, which is the only reason a bare `<a>` is enough here.

If you ever do want a link to force a real document load — leaving the runtime
and all its state behind — mark that one `<a data-rmx-document>`.

## Base paths and GitHub Pages

A GitHub Pages _project_ site is served under a sub-path
(`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), and per-PR previews add a further segment.
`client/base.ts` turns the `BASE_URL` the deploy workflow sets into that prefix;
the shell, the pages and the router all read it from there, and the build strips
it back off when writing so the output always lands at `dist/`'s root.

Locally `BASE_URL` is unset and the site is served from `/`. To preview a
sub-path deployment:

```sh
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/remix3-ssg-gh-pages deno task dev
```

`deno serve` prints the root URL, but with `BASE_URL` set the site lives under
the prefix — open <http://localhost:8000/remix3-ssg-gh-pages>.

### Which file answers which URL

GitHub Pages serves `/about` from `about.html`, and 404s `/about/` when only
that file exists. `server/router.ts` states that rule as
`fileServer = githubPages()`, and the build writes the file it would reach for.
Deploying somewhere with different rules is a matter of exporting a different
behavior.

The dev server does not emulate the host — it answers the URLs the routes
declare, which is the same set for every rule that matters here: `/about` is a
route, `/about/` is not, and neither is `/about.html`. The one thing Pages is
more forgiving about is that last one, serving a page at the file's own name
too; a link written that way fails the build here instead, which is the more
useful direction to be wrong in.

Deployment is wired up in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` at the repository root.
